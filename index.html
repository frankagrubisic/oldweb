    	<!-- the backstory -->
    	<section id="backstory" class="secs">
			<p>Hi, I'm Franka, a happy Croatian developer &amp; digital designer based in Zagreb. I'm a Computer Engineering student, majoring in Multimedia Computing, and I have a collection of random engineering and non-engineering related interests üôã</p>

			<p>I have a problem solving mentality which is why I am in love with computer science and design. They solve problems. I would say that I am a multidisciplinary, thoughtful and empathetic designer/developer that obsesses over every detail (whoops).</p>  

			<p>Since I was a kid, I wanted to do something that would be useful to the world. Something that would make someone's life easier - ahhhh, classic millenial, right?, to <span class="italic">"Create something meaningful"</span>. I also never hold myself back and focus on "just the one thing". I believe that with "feeding" my many interests not only does my curiosity blossom, but I also expand my base knowledge and then have the ability to think more broadly and create connections that previously weren't there.</p>

			<p>You can find me trying to write on <a href="https://medium.com/me/stories/public">Medium</a>, watching others post on <a href="https://twitter.com/franka_gr">Twitter</a>, sharing doggo stories on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/frankagr/">Instagram</a> and underusing <a href="https://dribbble.com/franka">Dribbble</a>.</p><br>

			<p><span class="italic quote">‚≠ê How can I accept a limited, definable self, when I feel, in me, all possibilities? ‚≠ê</span></p>

		<!-- passion -->
		<section id="passion" class="secs">
			<p><span class="underlined">What am I passionate about?</span><br>
			Creating. And whilst doing that, combining both, my engineering and artsy side. That‚Äôs why I love geospatial engineering, especially cartography ~ there is so much math behind it, yet I can have my artistic input when constructing it. Same goes with front-end web development as I can code and design in the same time. I am a visual type, so projects like this suit me.</p>

			<p>I am also very passionate about contributing to open source. I'm an active OpenStreetMap contributor, as well as a mentor and teacher and I preach open source whenever I have the opportunity ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

			<p>If you are an open source organisation, or know one that needs help, I would love to help with any contributions that would benefit from my skills and expertise. </p>
		</section>


		<!-- knowledge -->
		<section id="knowledge" class="secs">
			<p><span class="underlined">So what in the Earth do I know?</span><br>
			I know Python, HTML, CSS and a bit of Javascript (currently in development) and this semester I am also learning PHP on my Uni. I prefer UNIX, but I know Windows too (of course). I use Git for tracking my projects. I also know Bootstrap and I constantly find myself discovering new frameworks (Bulma being my latest obsession).</p>

			<p>I have good knowledge and understanding of geospatial intelligence and data because of my 150/180 finished ECTS points towards a BSc in Geodesy and Geo-Information Science (GIS), before I decided to switch to Computer Science (CS). I would say that my GIS and CS skills are complementary and that it makes a great asset for a spatial-oriented development team. </p> 

			<p>So now we‚Äôve come to my artsy side, yay! I've worked in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign for the last 10/6/4 years, creating websites and other web-content, promo-materials and magazines. I have been Chief Graphic Designer for a student magazine for 3 years and when that came to an end, I started doing some bespoke design and create custom-made stationery, made from scratch for each client.</p>

			<p>I also like managing projects and teams. This is another reason why knowing a range of topics comes in handy ~ a good manager must be able to communicate between different departments and understand what each of them is saying in order to make the project efficient and successful.</p>

			<p>It‚Äôs hard for me to assess my work as I always think I could do better or know more. But, what I don‚Äôt feel bad saying is that I am an eager learner. Things I don‚Äôt know are always a challenge that I choose to take!</p>

		<!-- endeavours -->
		<section id="endeavours" class="secs">
			<p><span class="underlined">My current endeavours:</span><br>
			<span class="italic">Topics I am currently learning:</span> VR, Unity, React<br>
			<span class="italic">What I‚Äôd like to master:</span> Back-end development, Android development</p>

			<p>I have always been fascinated with the human-design connection, how to accomplish the most genuine and intuitive design (for humans) using simple design elements, so that everything seems nature-like, integrated. Like you wouldn‚Äôt know the difference between nature made and human made. And since I was always interested with human psychology and how it interacts with design, it‚Äôs no wonder I am interested in UX/UI design, right?</p>

			<p><span class="italic">Languages I know:</span> Croatian, English, Italian, Spanish. I understand German (ein bisschen). I've also listened to French and Japanese for one semester, but they definitely require further learning.<br>
			<span class="italic">Languages I would like to know:</span> Portuguese and Korean<br>
			<span class="italic">Currently learning:</span> Korean</p>

		<!-- why dis -->
		<section id="why" class="secs">
			<p>The hardest part of making this website was deciding in which ‚Äòformat‚Äô will I present the data (aka what I did throughout my life so far). </p>

			<p>I decided for this laid-back, personal, descriptive option as everything I did is written down in my <a href="#unique-modal-id">CV</a> and honestly, I couldn't bother trying to shorten my long CV to a page - there is no need to brag about honours and awards here. This way, I can show you a piece of me when you stumble upon this site, which cannot be read from a classic r√©sum√©. For more comprehensive details about my work experience and accomplishments, check out my LinkedIN profile or the <a href="#unique-modal-id">CV</a>, whichever you prefer.
